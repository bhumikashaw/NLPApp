This is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) App that performs three main tasks: Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, and Language Detection.
The application is built using NLP Cloud models and works by connecting to the NLP Cloud API.
To use this app, users need to create an account on NLP Cloud, generate an API key, and provide that key within the application to perform the NLP tasks on input text. 
This project represents my first hands-on implementation of an NLP-based application, so the results may not always be perfectly accurate. 
However, it serves as a learning-focused project to understand how NLP models and cloud-based NLP services can be integrated into real-world applications.
